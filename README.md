# MARTA-2.0

## __Initial Setup: Instructions to follow before running the project__
* Before running the project you need to have __Blender__ installed on your system. For downloading blender, visit: [Install Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
* You need to have __Rokoko Studio addon__, Rokoko is an AI tool that performs the retargetting process on armatures (Retargetting is the transfer of animation or pose from one armature to another)
  For downloading rokoko and enabling in blender you can follow the tutorial: [Install Rokoko Studio for blender](https://support.rokoko.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410463492241-Install-the-Blender-plugin)
  Open Blender and switch to Layout mode. Then, open the Rokoko add-on and sign up for a Rokoko account.
* For 3D modeling and rigging, we used __MakeHuman__ which is an open source tool for making custom humanoid characters, they provide an addon for blender and you can download it by following this tutorial: [Install MakeHuman for Blender](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman-plugin-for-blender)
  I downloaded __MakeHuman Community__ and used that for making my own characters for animations. I found it more easy and quick as compared to Blender addon. Here is the link: [Install MakeHuman Community](https://static.makehumancommunity.org/makehuman/releases.html)
  With the separate interface you get every option in front of you which is better than working with addon and in Blender it is slower. Before exporting do not forget to attach rig to the character. I used the __Game Engine__ rig which is simpler and fits perfectly with 
  Momask Animations. For more clothes, skins, poses and other assets, visit this site: [Install Additional Assets for MakeHuman characters](https://static.makehumancommunity.org/assets/assetpacks.html)
