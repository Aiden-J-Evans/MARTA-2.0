In a bustling town called Jericho, there lived a rich man named Zacchaeus. He was a tax collector, but many disliked him for being greedy and unfair. One day, Zacchaeus heard about Jesus, a kind teacher visiting their town. Curious, Zacchaeus climbed a tree to see Jesus above the crowd. Jesus noticed him and surprised everyone by saying he would visit Zacchaeus' house. This changed Zacchaeus. He promised to be honest and share his wealth with those in need. Jesus praised Zacchaeus for changing his ways, showing that everyone can find forgiveness and start anew.
