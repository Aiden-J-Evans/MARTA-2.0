David was a shepherd boy who lived in Israel.  One day a giant named Goliath started bragging to his soldier friends that none of the Israelites would dare to fight him. The Israelite soldiers were all afraid of the giant Goliath. The King of Israel Saul was also unable to stop him. Thatâ€™s when little David decided to face Goliath himself. He went and got some stones and a slingshot to combat the Giant.The giant ridiculed David. But he went in with all his faith. He took a stone and put it in his sling and flung it at Goliath. The stone hit Goliath on the forehead and he fell to the ground immediately. Then David killed him with his sword. All the Philistines ran away and Israel was protected. The faithful shepherd boy had saved the Jewish people with the help of the Lord.
A woodcutter accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god Hermes (also known as Mercury) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. "Was this what you had lost?", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.
